<p>The purpose of this analysis is to determine the current state of this fictional company, as well as determine any future risks and ways to increase revenue going forward.</p>

<p>The company is an online retailer based in the United Kingdom that sells mainly to wholesaler businesses. We will assume their transactions are conducted in English Pounds.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the dataset only contains sales data, so revenue is the only financial metric to work with. As a result, we will not consider costs of goods sold when analyzing the state of the company. </p>
